# dstack KMS Builder

This directory contains the necessary files to build and run the dstack-kms Docker image for development.

## Overview

The builder creates a Docker image that includes:
- The dstack-kms service compiled from Rust source code
- Pure-Rust ACPI measurement support built into the dstack-kms binary

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Buildx v0.13.0+ (the script creates a BuildKit v0.20.2 builder)
- Git

## Building the Image

To build the KMS Docker image, use the provided `build-image.sh` script:

```bash
./build-image.sh <image-name>[:<tag>]...
```

For example:
```bash
./build-image.sh kvin/kms
```

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GIT_REV` | Revision to build (default `HEAD`) |
| `DSTACK_CLONE_TOKEN` | Token for a private `DSTACK_SRC_URL`. Passed as a BuildKit secret, not a build-arg. |
| `IMAGE_VERSION` | Version recorded in the image metadata (default `dev`) |
| `IMAGE_SOURCE_URL` | Repository URL recorded in the image metadata |
| `NO_CACHE` | Set to any value to build without the layer cache |
| `OCI_TAR` | Also write an OCI archive here, for digest comparison |
| `METADATA_FILE` | Write the validated OCI manifest digest and build metadata here |
| `PUSH` | Set to any value to push the tags instead of only loading them |

Publication and OCI export happen only after both package lists pass validation.
`NO_CACHE` applies to the validation builds; export then reuses their cached result.
Manual release workflows require an existing component release tag and check out
that tag, rather than building the branch selected in the workflow UI.

## Reproducing a released image

Release CI runs this same script, so a published image can be rebuilt and
checked digest-for-digest. Use a clean checkout of the release commit so the
Dockerfile, package lists, shared scripts and copied files also match the release.
From the repository root (fetch the tag first if it is not available locally):

```bash
git switch --detach "kms-v0.6.0^{commit}"
cd dstack/kms/dstack-app/builder

GIT_REV=HEAD \
IMAGE_VERSION=0.6.0 \
IMAGE_SOURCE_URL=https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack \
OCI_TAR=/tmp/kms.oci.tar \
  ./build-image.sh ghcr.io/dstack-tee/dstack-kms:0.6.0

python3 -c 'import json,tarfile;t=tarfile.open("/tmp/kms.oci.tar");print(json.load(t.extractfile("index.json"))["manifests"][0]["digest"])'
```

`IMAGE_VERSION` is part of the image metadata, so it must match the release for
the digests to match. The printed digest is what the registry reports for
`ghcr.io/dstack-tee/dstack-kms:0.6.0`; compare it with:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/dstack-tee/dstack-kms:0.6.0 --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'
```

`deploy-to-vmm.sh` pins `KMS_IMAGE` by digest, and that digest feeds the compose
hash registered on chain. Its default is still a 0.5.x Docker Hub digest matching
`OS_IMAGE=dstack-0.5.5`; to deploy 0.6.0 or later, set `KMS_IMAGE` to the GHCR
digest verified above.

## Image metadata

The image carries its provenance as OCI metadata in three places, all generated
from one definition in `dstack/build/shared/build-lib.sh`:

- config labels — `docker inspect -f '{{json .Config.Labels}}' <image>`
- manifest annotations — `docker buildx imagetools inspect <image>`
- `/etc/dstack-kms/build-info` inside the image, readable from within the CVM

## Running the Built Image

### Using Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the KMS service is using the provided `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  kms:
    image: kvin/kms
    ports:
      - "8003:8000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./kms:/kms
    environment:
      - IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL=${IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL:-http://localhost:8001/mr_{OS_IMAGE_HASH}.tar.gz}
      - AUTH_TYPE=dev
      - DEV_DOMAIN=kms.1022.dstack.org
      - QUOTE_ENABLED=false
```

To start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
