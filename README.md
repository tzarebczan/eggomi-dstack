## What is dstack?

dstack is the open framework for confidential AI — deploy AI applications with cryptographic privacy guarantees.

AI providers ask users to trust them with sensitive data. But trust doesn't scale, and trust can't be verified. With dstack, your containers run inside confidential VMs (Intel TDX) with native support for NVIDIA Confidential Computing (H100, Blackwell). Users can cryptographically verify exactly what's running: private AI with your existing Docker workflow.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Attestation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Bare metal TDX** | Available | TDX |
| **Bare metal AMD SEV-SNP** | Host support; requires an SNP-capable guest image | SEV-SNP |
| **[Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network)** | Available | TDX |
| **GCP Confidential VMs** | Available | TDX + TPM |
| **AWS Nitro Enclaves** | Available | NSM |

## Features

**Zero friction onboarding**
- **Docker Compose native**: Bring your docker-compose.yaml as-is. No SDK, no code changes.
- **Encrypted by default**: Network traffic and disk storage encrypted out of the box.

**Hardware-rooted security**
- **Private by hardware**: Data encrypted in memory, inaccessible even to the host.
- **Reproducible OS**: Deterministic builds mean anyone can verify the OS image hash.
- **Workload identity**: Every app gets an attested identity users can verify cryptographically.
- **Confidential GPUs**: Native support for NVIDIA Confidential Computing (H100, Blackwell).

**Trustless operations**
- **Isolated keys**: Per-app keys derived in TEE. Survives hardware failure. Never exposed to operators.
- **Code governance**: Updates follow predefined rules (e.g., multi-party approval). Operators can't swap code or access secrets.

## Getting Started

**Try it now:** Chat with LLMs running in TEE at [chat.redpill.ai](https://chat.redpill.ai). Click the shield icon to verify attestations from Intel TDX and NVIDIA GPUs.

**Deploy your own:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
services:
  vllm:
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:latest
    runtime: nvidia
    command: --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

Deploy to a self-hosted TDX machine with the `dstackup install` -> `dstack deploy` workflow, or use [Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network) for managed infrastructure. AMD SEV-SNP hosts use the same workflow when the selected guest image includes `digest.txt`.

Setting up dstack on your own hardware? Start with the [self-hosted quick onboarding guide](./docs/onboarding.md)

Building or customizing the guest OS itself? Follow the [guest-OS build guide](./docs/building-guest-os.md).

Developing without TEE hardware? Use a development image with
[no-TEE mode and swtpm](./docs/development-without-tee.md).
For Eggomi's AMD path, follow the
[simulated SEV-SNP guide](./docs/eggomi/development-with-simulated-snp.md).

## Architecture

### Repository layout

```text
dstack/  Core services, Rust crates, host and guest runtime code
sdk/     Stable public SDK paths
os/      Guest-OS payload, image contract, and build backends
docs/    User and operator documentation
tools/   Standalone development and security tools
```

The default and recommended OS backend is mkosi under `os/mkosi/`. The Yocto
backend under `os/yocto/` is deprecated and kept only to rebuild existing
images; do not use it for new work. Shared rootfs payload and release assembly
stay outside the backends so they are not duplicated. See
[`os/README.md`](./os/README.md).

Scripts follow the same ownership boundaries: component-specific helpers stay
beside their component under `dstack/`; files installed into every guest live
in `os/common/rootfs/`; backend-neutral image tooling lives in `os/image/`;
mkosi-only helpers live in `os/mkosi/scripts/` (deprecated Yocto-only helpers
in `os/yocto/scripts/`); and repository-wide standalone utilities live in
`tools/`.

Your container runs inside a Confidential VM, such as Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP, with optional GPU isolation via NVIDIA Confidential Computing. The CPU TEE protects application logic; the GPU TEE protects model weights and inference data.

**Core components:**

- **Guest Agent**: Runs inside each CVM. Generates TDX attestation quotes so users can verify exactly what's running. Provisions per-app cryptographic keys from KMS. Encrypts local storage. Apps interact via `/var/run/dstack.sock`.

- **KMS**: Runs in its own TEE. Verifies TDX quotes before releasing keys. Enforces authorization policies defined in on-chain smart contracts — operators cannot bypass these checks. Derives deterministic keys bound to each app's attested identity.

- **Gateway**: Terminates TLS at the edge and provisions ACME certificates automatically. Routes traffic to CVMs. All internal communication uses RA-TLS for mutual attestation.

- **VMM**: Runs on bare-metal TDX hosts. Parses docker-compose files directly — no app changes needed. Boots CVMs from a reproducible OS image. Allocates CPU, memory, and confidential GPU resources.

## Security and Trust

Security docs are linked here so deployers and reviewers can quickly find the trust model, production guidance, audit, and the status of already-answered public findings.

- [Security Overview](./docs/security/) - entry point for users, operators, researchers, and AI agents
- [Security Model](./docs/security/security-model.md) - threat model, trust boundaries, and verification checklist
- [Public Security Reports](./docs/security/public-security-reports.md) - public status for security reports and related hardening work
- [Security Best Practices](./docs/security/security-best-practices.md) - production settings and hardening guidance
- [Security Audit](./docs/security/dstack-audit.pdf) - third-party audit by zkSecurity
- [Report a Vulnerability](./SECURITY.md) - use GitHub's private security reporting path

Please do not disclose exploitable vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues. Use the private reporting path in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## SDKs

Apps communicate with the guest agent via HTTP over `/var/run/dstack.sock`. Use the [HTTP API](./sdk/curl/api.md) directly with curl, or use a language SDK:

| Language | Install | Docs |
|----------|---------|------|
| Python | `pip install dstack-sdk` | [README](./sdk/python/README.md) |
| TypeScript | `npm install @phala/dstack-sdk` | [README](./sdk/js/README.md) |
| Rust | `cargo add dstack-sdk` | [README](./sdk/rust/README.md) |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not use AWS Nitro / Azure Confidential VMs / GCP directly?</strong></summary>

You can — but you'll build everything yourself: attestation verification, key management, Docker orchestration, certificate provisioning, and governance. dstack provides all of this out of the box.

| Approach | Docker native | GPU TEE | Key management | Attestation tooling | Open source |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|
| **dstack** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| AWS Nitro Enclaves | - | - | Manual | Manual | - |
| Azure Confidential VMs | - | Preview | Manual | Manual | - |
| GCP Confidential Computing | - | - | Manual | Manual | - |

Cloud providers give you the hardware primitive. dstack gives you the full stack: reproducible OS images, automatic attestation, per-app key derivation, TLS certificates, and smart contract governance. No vendor lock-in.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from SGX/Gramine?</strong></summary>

SGX requires porting applications to enclaves. dstack uses full-VM isolation (Intel TDX) — bring your Docker containers as-is. Plus GPU TEE support that SGX doesn't offer.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the performance overhead?</strong></summary>

Minimal. Intel TDX adds ~2-5% overhead for CPU workloads. NVIDIA Confidential Computing has negligible impact on GPU inference. The main cost is memory encryption, which is hardware-accelerated on supported CPUs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this production-ready?</strong></summary>

Yes. dstack powers production AI infrastructure at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/provider/phala) and [NEAR AI](https://x.com/ilblackdragon/status/1962920246148268235). The framework has been [audited by zkSecurity](./docs/security/dstack-audit.pdf) and is a Linux Foundation Confidential Computing Consortium project.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this on my own hardware?</strong></summary>

Yes. dstack runs on supported TEE-capable servers, including Intel TDX-capable hardware. See the [deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md) for self-hosting instructions. You can also use [Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network) for managed infrastructure.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What TEE hardware is supported?</strong></summary>

- **GCP**: Intel TDX (Confidential VMs)
- **AWS**: Nitro Enclaves (NSM attestation)
- **Bare metal**: Intel TDX (4th/5th Gen Xeon) and AMD SEV-SNP on supported dstack OS images. Intel TDX is the production path; AMD SEV-SNP is new and experimental.
- **GPUs**: NVIDIA Confidential Computing (H100, Blackwell)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do users verify my deployment?</strong></summary>

Your app exposes attestation quotes via the SDK. Users verify these quotes using [dstack-verifier](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/tree/next/dstack/verifier), [dcap-qvl](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dcap-qvl), or the [Trust Center](https://trust.phala.com). See the [verification guide](./docs/verification.md) for details.
